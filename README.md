# Django-DDD

Apply Domain-driven Design to Django without Django Rest Framework. 
This could be an overkill for using Django, but on the other hand, it's going to be an interesting experiment.

Most project hierarchies are similar to [python-ddd project](https://github.com/qu3vipon/python-ddd).

## Opinion
DRF has the advantage of being able to create the web applications quickly, but it is inherently too dependent on the database. I want to take advantage of Django's built-in Admin and ORM, but I have sometimes suffered from DRF because of its inflexible design.

I'm planning to create a new framework on top of Django to replace DRF someday.
This repo is a proof of concept project before that.

But I still think DRF is a very good framework, and I highly value DRF's contribution to the Python web community.
